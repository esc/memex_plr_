A MEMory EXpansion for my Programming Langage (PL) Research (R)

## About

This is a memex for my programming language research. It's intent is to capture
any media and thoughts I consume related to my personal programming language
research journey. The concept is based on Vaneevar Bush's hypothetical
electromenachical device -- the memex -- conceived in 1945 to serve as an
enlarged intimate supplement to a human's memory. However, since this
construct was rezzed in 2024, it can exist across a vastly advanced landscape,
70 years beyond electromechnical devices that store documents on microfiche.
It is implemented as a simple `git` repository where the content can be
created, modified and searched via simple command line tools such as a shell,
simple files and directory navigation and severl options for advanced text
editors to record input (even something like speech to text is readily
available with several different options). I initiated this as a
way to retain and organize both the material I read about this topic and any
mental associations that arise so as to retain the knowledge encased and act as
a refresher of important learnings. Think of it like a retro-futuristic form of
a lab-journal.
