Turing Machines and Cellular Automata
-------------------------------------

While reading:

* https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2024/08/whats-really-going-on-in-machine-learning-some-minimal-models/


it occurred to me that there may be an isomorphism between 2D turing machines
and cellular automata. In fact the wikipedia page at:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton

states that:

```
The concept was originally discovered in the 1940s by Stanislaw Ulam and John
von Neumann while they were contemporaries at Los Alamos National Laboratory.
While studied by some throughout the 1950s and 1960s, it was not until the
1970s and Conway's Game of Life, a two-dimensional cellular automaton, that
interest in the subject expanded beyond academia. In the 1980s, Stephen Wolfram
engaged in a systematic study of one-dimensional cellular automata, or what he
calls elementary cellular automata; his research assistant Matthew Cook showed
that one of these rules is Turing-complete.
```

The paper from Cook is available at:

and I have made a note to ingest and read this at a later stage.
