Today I ingest the first article into my `memex[plr]`. It is the original
article that coined the term. I am also adding an OCR (via Goggle drive) `txt`
file which I had edited for typos and corrections. Both files come from an
earlier non-public variant of a memex, so I didn't recall the original
file-link. Searching through my browser downloads revealed the origin:

https://cdn.theatlantic.com/media/archives/1945/07/176-1/132407932.pdf

The file is now at:

[media/documents/1945-bush.pdf](../../../../media/documents/1945-bush.pdf)

And added to the memex using `git-lfs`.
